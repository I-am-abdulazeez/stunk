# Stunk - Development Roadmap

> **Current Status**: 100+ GitHub stars | 2.95kb gzipped (core + React) | Production-ready

## Phase 1: Core Experience Enhancement (Priority: High)

### 🔥 Computed Function Redesign 
**Target: Make computed functions more intuitive**

**Current API:**
```javascript
const fullNameChunk = computed(
  [firstNameChunk, lastNameChunk, ageChunk], 
  (firstName, lastName, age) => ({
     fullName: `${firstName} ${lastName}`,
     isAdult: age >= 18,
  })
)
```

**New API:**
```javascript  
const fullNameChunk = computed(() => ({
  fullName: `${firstNameChunk.get()} ${lastNameChunk.get()}`,
  isAdult: ageChunk.get() >= 18,
}))
```

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Build dependency tracking system that detects `.get()` calls during execution
- Use Proxy or function wrapping to intercept chunk access
- Maintain backward compatibility with current API
- Add automatic cleanup when dependencies change

**Benefits:**
- More intuitive and readable
- No dependency arrays to maintain
- Automatic dependency detection
- Looks like natural JavaScript

## Phase 2: Framework Expansion (Priority: High)

### ✅ React Integration (Complete)
- All hooks implemented and battle-tested
- Bundle size optimized (included in 2.95kb total)

### 🚧 Vue Composables (In Progress)
**Target: Full Vue 3 Composition API support**
- `useChunk` - Core chunk binding with Vue reactivity
- `useComputed` - Computed values integrated with Vue's system
- `useAsyncChunk` - Async state management with Vue lifecycle
- `useChunkProperty` - Property-specific subscriptions
- SSR compatibility for Nuxt
- Optional Options API helpers

### 📋 Future Framework Support

## Long-term Vision (12-18 months)

**Stunk as the lightweight, universal state management solution**

Position Stunk as the go-to choice for:
- **Performance-conscious teams** who need small bundles
- **Multi-framework organizations** requiring consistency
- **Library authors** building framework-agnostic tools
- **Migration projects** moving between state solutions
- **Modern applications** that need async-first state management

### Key Differentiators
- **Smallest bundle** with most features
- **Framework agnostic** core with first-class integrations
- **Async-first** design for modern applications
- **Developer experience** focused on intuitive APIs
- **Production proven** with comprehensive testing

The goal is to make Stunk the obvious choice when developers need powerful, lightweight state management that works everywhere.
