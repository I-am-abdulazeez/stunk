# Stunk - Development Roadmap 🚧

> **Current Status**: 110+ GitHub stars | 2.95kb gzipped (core + React) | Production-ready

## ✅ Recently Completed (Excellent Progress!)
- **4 comparison articles** (Stunk vs Zustand/Jotai/Pinia) - Deep dive content ✓
- **10+ showcase applications** - Real-world usage demonstrations ✓
- **110+ GitHub stars** - Strong community foundation ✓
- **2.95kb gzipped bundle** - Industry-leading bundle size ✓

---

## Phase 1: Core Experience Enhancement (Priority: High)

### 🔥 Computed Function Redesign - **6-8 weeks**
**Target: Make computed functions more intuitive**

**Current API:**
```javascript
const fullNameChunk = computed(
  [firstNameChunk, lastNameChunk, ageChunk], 
  (firstName, lastName, age) => ({
     fullName: `${firstName} ${lastName}`,
     isAdult: age >= 18,
  })
)
```

**New API:**
```javascript  
const fullNameChunk = computed(() => ({
  fullName: `${firstNameChunk.get()} ${lastNameChunk.get()}`,
  isAdult: ageChunk.get() >= 18,
}))
```

**Realistic Implementation Timeline:**
- **Week 1-2:** Dependency tracking system research & prototype
- **Week 3-4:** Implementation with Proxy-based detection
- **Week 5-6:** Testing, edge cases, performance validation
- **Week 7-8:** Documentation update, backward compatibility testing

**Benefits:**
- More intuitive and readable
- No dependency arrays to maintain
- Automatic dependency detection
- Looks like natural JavaScript

*Reality check: Dependency tracking is complex - SolidJS and MobX took years to perfect this. Budget extra time for edge cases.*

## Phase 2: Framework Expansion (Priority: High)

### ✅ React Integration (Complete)
- All hooks implemented and battle-tested
- Bundle size optimized (included in 2.95kb total)

### 🚧 Vue Composables Completion - **4-6 weeks** (can overlap with computed work)
**Target: Full Vue 3 Composition API support**

**Timeline:**
- **Week 1-2:** Core composables (`useChunk`, `useComputed`, `useAsyncChunk`)
- **Week 3-4:** Advanced composables (`useChunkProperty`, `useChunkValues`), SSR compatibility
- **Week 5-6:** Testing, documentation, Vue ecosystem validation

**Deliverables:**
- `useChunk` - Core chunk binding with Vue reactivity
- `useComputed` - Computed values integrated with Vue's system
- `useAsyncChunk` - Async state management with Vue lifecycle
- `useChunkProperty` - Property-specific subscriptions
- SSR compatibility for Nuxt
- Optional Options API helpers

### 📋 Svelte Integration - **3-4 weeks** *(after Vue completion)*
- **Svelte stores integration** - Native stores compatibility
- Svelte stores are simpler than Vue reactivity
- Can leverage lessons learned from Vue integration

### 📋 Future Framework Support *(Long-term)*
- **Angular** - Services and new Signals compatibility  
- **Solid.js** - Signal interoperability

---

## Phase 3: Growth & Adoption (Priority: High - Ongoing)

- **Week 2:** **Advanced patterns** and real-world examples  
- **Week 3:** Interactive playground integration

**Status:**
- ✅ Core documentation complete
- 🔄 **Expand best practices** section

## Long-term Vision (12-18 months)

**Stunk as the lightweight, universal state management solution**

Position Stunk as the go-to choice for:
- **Performance-conscious teams** who need small bundles
- **Multi-framework organizations** requiring consistency
- **Library authors** building framework-agnostic tools
- **Migration projects** moving between state solutions
- **Modern applications** that need async-first state management

### Key Differentiators
- **Smallest bundle** with most features
- **Framework agnostic** core with first-class integrations
- **Async-first** design for modern applications
- **Developer experience** focused on intuitive APIs
- **Production proven** with comprehensive testing

The goal is to make Stunk the obvious choice when developers need powerful, lightweight state management that works everywhere.
